EXPERIMENTAL SETUP DEFINITIONS
==============================

1. SAMPLE UNIT
   Each row = one neuron at one split decision point
   - A neuron is selected for potential splitting
   - Its metrics are recorded at the moment of decision
   - The split is performed and outcomes are measured

2. TARGET VARIABLE: delta_test_loss_at_h{N}
   delta = (test_loss_after_split at epoch+N) - (test_loss_of_unsplit_baseline at epoch+N)
   
   Interpretation:
   - delta < 0 → Split HELPED (test loss decreased)
   - delta > 0 → Split HURT (test loss increased)
   - delta ≈ 0 → No significant effect
   
   We want metrics with NEGATIVE correlation (higher metric → lower delta → better outcome)

3. REGIME
   Network architecture width category:
   - tiny: 10 hidden neurons
   - small: 20 hidden neurons
   - medium: 40 hidden neurons
   - large: 80 hidden neurons
   
   Analysis is done WITHIN each regime to avoid confounding from architecture size.

4. SPEARMAN CORRELATION (ρ)
   Rank-based correlation measuring monotonic relationship.
   - ρ = -0.3: Higher metric values predict better outcomes (split helps)
   - ρ = +0.3: Higher metric values predict worse outcomes (split hurts)
   - |ρ| > 0.1: Small effect
   - |ρ| > 0.3: Medium effect  
   - |ρ| > 0.5: Large effect

5. STATISTICAL TESTING
   - Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction applied
   - q < 0.05 threshold for significance
   - FDR controls expected proportion of false discoveries among rejected hypotheses

6. NON-IID DATA STRUCTURE
   Neurons are nested within networks:
   - Multiple neurons per network
   - Multiple networks per regime
   - Correlations within network may exist
   
   Report: number of unique networks (init_id) per regime

7. PRIMARY vs EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
   PRIMARY (pre-specified): 13 atomic metrics at h=8
   EXPLORATORY: All temporal metrics, all horizons
   
   Primary analysis conclusions are confirmatory.
   Exploratory analysis generates hypotheses for future testing.
